## Description
YouTube Book lets you upload YouTube videos as books with bookmarks and notes.

## To Run the server - Just do this once
* In root type `npm run start-dev` and go to localhost:8080
* You may have to refresh the page 2-5 times until you see collapsible green bars representing the YouTube Books. This is due to the YT videos not loading sometimes.

## To Build for Development - Do this every time changing a file
1. **Changing Client ts files**
    * Type `npm run build` in root whenever changing client ts files.

2. **Changing Server ts files**
    * Type `tsc` in src whenever changing server ts files.
